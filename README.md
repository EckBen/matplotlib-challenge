Pymaceuticals Analysis

1. In terms of mouse survival rates, Ramicane and Capomulin were the best drugs with ending survival rates of 80% and 84%, respectively. All other drugs were substantially worse with some drugs such as Propriva (26.9%), Infubinol(36%), and Stelasyn(42.3%) performing worse than the placebo (44%).

2. Ramicane and Capomulin were the only two drugs to decrease tumor volume. On average Ramicane decrease tumor volume by 22.32% and Capomulin decreased tumor volume by 19.48%. In comparison, the placebo group had an average of 51.30% increase in tumor volume. Unfortunately, Stelasyn (52.09%), Naftisol (53.92%), and Ketapril (57.03%) had greater average increases than the placebo.

3. Ramicane and Capomulin ended the study with the lowest average of metastatic sites as well at 1.250(SEM=0.190) sites and 1.476(SEM=0.203) sites, respectively. Stelasyn (1.727(SEM=0.359) sites) and Infubinol (2.111(SEM=0.309) sites) had similar performances. Ketapril (3.364(SEM=0.279) sites), however, performed similarly to the placebo (3.273(SEM=0.304) sites).

In summary, Ramicane and Capomulin were the strongest performing drugs, as compared to the control group, in survival rate, suppression of metastatic site proliferation, and reduction of tumor volume. Stelasyn had poor performance in survival rates and tumor reduction, but it did well to keep metastatic sites low. Ketapril had the same survival rate as the placebo but performed worse than the placebo at reducing tumor volume and keeping metastatic sites from forming.
